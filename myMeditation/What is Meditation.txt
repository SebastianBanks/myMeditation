Meditation can be a life changing habit that makes you a better person and builds skills that you’ll use everyday. Many people get the wrong idea on what meditation is. Many believe that meditation isn’t for them because their minds and just too busy. But really that’s what makes meditation perfect for them. Everyone can benefit from meditating, it will not only have an impact on you but the people around you.

So what is meditation, isn’t the whole goal to empty your mind of thoughts? Although you might experience this after some practice, emptying the mind of all thoughts isn’t really the point of meditation. Meditation is the practice of focusing your attention. Meaning you're not expected to have a completely blank mind during meditation. You’ll have thoughts and interruptions that you’ll gently push away by bringing your attention back to your breath or whatever your meditating on. As you practice this overtime you’ll have an increased ability to focus on a single thought and live your life more in the present.
